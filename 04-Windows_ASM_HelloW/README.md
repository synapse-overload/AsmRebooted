This small project is used to demonstrate writing programs in Assembly for Windows.
The assembler used is NASM and the linker will be used from MinGW.
Make sure you have these installed.


There is an assumption that you have nasm installed at: C:\NASM and 
GCC available at: C:\mingw-w64\i686-8.1.0-posix-dwarf-rt_v6-rev0\mingw32
