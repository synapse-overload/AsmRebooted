This is a simple Hello World program that is meant to show very basic usage for assembly programs.
The example is meant to be run in a **EMU8086** environment so make sure you download it from https://emu8086.emuapps.com/
After starting the emulator select COM Template.
To run press `Emulate` then `Run`

If using VS Code to read these files the 13xForever plugin for x86 and x86_64 syntax
highlighter is quite good.
